STEPS:

Install Required Libraries

Install the necessary Python libraries: pandas and autoscraper.
These libraries will allow us to manipulate data and scrape the website.
Define the Webpage URL

Set the URL of the webpage that you want to scrape. In this case, we will be scraping the URL for book titles and their prices.
Set the Desired Data

Specify the data you want to scrape by defining a list of items (e.g., book titles and prices) that will guide the scraper in extracting the correct information.
Initialize AutoScraper

Initialize the AutoScraper object, which will be responsible for scraping the data from the webpage.
Build the Scraper

Use the build() method of the AutoScraper to configure the scraper based on the desired data. This will allow the scraper to learn how to extract the book titles and prices from the webpage.
Scrape Data from the Webpage

After building the scraper, use the get_result_similar() method to retrieve the extracted data from the webpage.
Store the Data in a DataFrame

Convert the extracted data into a Pandas DataFrame, which will provide an easy way to organize, analyze, and manipulate the data.
Save the Data to a CSV File

Save the DataFrame to a CSV file. This file will contain the book titles and their prices, making it easy to analyze or use the data later.
Check the Output

The resulting CSV file will contain the scraped book titles and prices in a structured format.
Requirements
Python 3.x (tested with Python 3.12)
pandas: For data manipulation and CSV export.
autoscraper: For web scraping.
requests: To fetch the webpage content.
beautifulsoup4 and lxml: For parsing HTML content.
